	(2) On hostY, run routers 1-5 in order:
		java router <1> <hostX> <nse_Port> <router_Port1>
		java router <2> <hostX> <nse_Port> <router_Port2>
		java router <3> <hostX> <nse_Port> <router_Port3>
		java router <4> <hostX> <nse_Port> <router_Port4>
		java router <5> <hostX> <nse_Port> <router_Port5>

		these five terminal will print some messages of current processing steps
